When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you are collaborating with others.
    When you want to share your code with others.
    When you want others to evaluate or suggest changes to your code.
    When you want to have a backup of your work.
    When you want to share (open source) your code with the world.
