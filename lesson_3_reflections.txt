When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you are collaborating with others.
    When you want to share your code with others.
    When you want others to evaluate or suggest changes to your code.
    When you want to have a backup of your work.
    When you want to share (open source) your code with the world.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay-up-to-date with your remote repostiory?

    Because I might be working on a file that was update by someone else, so if it pulls, I will end up needing to merge the files. This could be confusing and time consuming.
    Additionally, if I'm currently working in a file and is updated and pulled automatically, I would end up overwriting the new file with the version I had open.

Describe the diffeences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    Forking is cloning someone else's repository into one of my own, while attriubuting them for the original creation.
    Cloning is duplicating everything, including files, commits, and everything else. It's a clone, a complete and perfect copy of the original.
    Branches are basically names for new commits in order to keep the original one in a separate named commit.
